Data generated by tree stucture to form matrix A

Similarity of subjects computed using gene similarity 

cbind matrices from different disciplines to make A

run UASE on matrix A = UDV^T

U is clustering, want to use U to recover tree topology 

inner products of points/clusters is merge height

UPGMA - replace euclidean distance with inner product

All matrices share same tree - on different scales

Deal with mixture by breaking genome into segments - try anomaly detection to find mixture 

Aim to be able to not have to remove the mixture 

Annie's work:
General High-dim data Y size nxp 

Tree structure producing Z = {1,...,k}

Assign n individuals to one of k clusters

To get columns of Y add different levels of noise based on tree structure
Generative noise can be different for each column but tree structure stays the same


NEED PCA AND INNER PRODUCT


PCA: Don't center or scale 

A= Y x Y^T


Write up problem more formally

QUESTION 1:
Ignore mixture for this 
ONly got data with RW non transform get SVD:
A = UDV^T

Take A = [A1|...|Ak]
ONly look at V associated with A1, shouldn't be corrupted by other data, should be denoised by it. 
Build UPGMA tree based on the U
Joint framework increases ability ot infer from individual 
Does learning about the first pop help us understand the second by denoising 
How does V change with the embedding 

       
Could be a Stochastic Block Model w 3 clusters
